**News Reader iOS App**

Welcome to the News Reader iOS App! This is a simple yet powerful app that allows users to read the latest news from various sources. 
Built using SwiftUI, Combine Framework, and MVVM Architecture, this app demonstrates modern iOS development techniques while offering an intuitive and seamless user experience.


**Features:**
News Feed: Get the latest headlines and news articles from multiple sources.
Categories: Browse news by different categories like World, Sports, Technology, and more.
Detailed View: Read detailed news articles by selecting any item from the list.
Dynamic Updates: Using Combine, the app automatically fetches the latest news and updates the UI reactively.

**Architecture**
This app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern:
Model: Represents the data (e.g., news articles, categories) and business logic.
View: SwiftUI views that define the UI of the app.
ViewModel: Acts as a bridge between the Model and View, managing the state and business logic using the Combine Framework.


**Technologies Used**
SwiftUI: To build the user interface.
Combine Framework: For handling asynchronous data streams and managing state updates reactively.
MVVM Architecture: To separate concerns and improve testability and scalability.
URLSession: To fetch news articles from an external API.
